.SH NAME
\fB_printf\fP - formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
_printf FORMAT [ARGUMENT]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The printf utility formats and prints its arguments, under control of the FORMAT string.
FORMAT is a character string, which includes three types of objects: plain characters, escape sequences, and format specifiers. The format specifiers are introduced by the '%' character, and cause subsequent arguments to be formatted and printed according to the specifier.
    The following format specifiers are supported:
    %d   Print an integer.
    %f   Print a floating-point number.
    %c   Print a character.
    %s   Print a string.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion, _printf returns the number of characters written. Otherwise, a negative number is returned to indicate an error.
.SH EXAMPLES
Basic usage:
       _printf("Hello, World!\n")
    Formatting an integer:
       _printf("The value is %d\n", 42)
    Formatting a floating-point number:
       _printf("Pi is approximately %f\n", 3.14159)
    Formatting a character:
       _printf("character: %c\n", "a")
    Formatting a string:
       _printf("Name: %s\n", "Alice")
